# COVID-19 Data Visualization

[![GitHub commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/MatteGarba/Covid19-Data-Visualization)](https://github.com/MatteGarba/Covid19-Data-Visualization/commits/main)

In this project my aim is to play with the selected datasets, generate plots and animations and improve my data visualization skills.

### Main features developed:
*   Plot daily/cumulative data** of signle country;  
![img1](IMG1-Single-country-plots.png)
*   Plot Comparative daily/cumulative data** of multiple countries;  
![img2](IMG2-Multiple-countries-plot.png)
*   Plot a pie chart of the data*;  
![img3](IMG3-Pie-global-countries.png)
*   Plot a bar chart of data*** w.r.t. country population;  
![img4](IMG4-Bar-global-countries.png)
*   Generate an animation of a pie chart of the data** from Jan to today;
*   Generate an animation of a bar chart of the data*** from Jan to today;
*   Plot color filled single country plot with cases & deaths together;

*   Plot comparative daily/cumulative N-days running averaged data** of a single country;

(\*\*) Refers to: confirmed, deaths and recovered cases  
(\*\*\*) Refers to: confirmed, deaths and recovered cases + usage of population data  

### Datasets:

*   __COVID-19 Data Repository__ by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University ([CSS JHU repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19))
*   __Population by country 2020__ from the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/tanuprabhu/population-by-country-2020)


### Repository structure:
* Code of the project available in two versions: .py & .ipynb (it is suggested to work on *Google Colaboratory* as I did and it is guaranteed to work);
* A local copy of the population dataset that for simplicity is in this repository to be automatically imported while running the code;
* README.md file and possibly some images used for this presentation;
